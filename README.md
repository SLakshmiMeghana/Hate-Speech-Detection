# Hate Speech Detection

## Introduction
Hate Speech Detection is a project aimed at identifying and classifying hate speech in text data. This repository contains the code and resources used to train, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model for detecting hate speech.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using various techniques
- Model training using state-of-the-art algorithms
- Evaluation and performance metrics
- Visualization of results


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled tweets indicating whether they contain hate speech or not. You can find and download the dataset from [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-detection). 
## Model
This project uses a Decision Tree classifier to detect hate speech.
